# Run with us

This is a platform where my friends and I can collectively or individually track our running and gym progress. 
The users, or my friends, will also receive weekly reports of their overall runs and those of the rest of the group, by email or another method.

The goal is to gather our running data from:
- **Strava**
- **Nike Run Club**
- and, if possible, the **Apple Health app**.
